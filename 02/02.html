          <h1>Some Categories of People Regarding Fasting</h1>
          <p class="lead">Excerpts from Majaalisu-shahri ramadhaan by Shaykh Ibn-l-'uthaymeen</p>
          <p>Translated by Abdulquadri Alaka</p>
          <h6>Ramadan 19, 1434 | May 24, 2019</h6>
        </div>
        <p> All praises and adoration are due to Allah. Peace and blessings of Allah be upon the best of mankind,
          Muhammad, his households, his companions and the generality of the muslims.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right    "></i> A mature, mentally fit, healthily strong, free (from all factors
          impeding fasting), resident
          Muslim</h3>
        <p>
          The ruling is that fasting is compulsory on him and he has to observe it at its due time. The Quran, the
          Sunnah and the consensus of scholars supported this ruling. Allah says:
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p><q>The month of Ramadân in which was revealed the Qur'ân, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for
                the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the
                first night of) the month (of Ramadân i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Saum (fasts) that
                month,…</q></p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">in Suuratul-Baqarah, verse 185</cite></footer>
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>The prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam also said “ whenever you see the crescent (indicating the beginning of
          Ramadan as a month), start fasting.” (Bukhari and Muslim). Likewise, the whole Muslim world agreed that
          fasting is compulsory on this category of persons. </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, fasting is not compulsory on a
          disbeliever. If he chooses to fast, it will not be acceptable from him because he is yet to be certified for
          Allah’s worship. In other words, accepting Islaam comes first. On this note, if a disbeliever should accept
          Islam during the month of Ramadan after the start of the month, it is not binding on him to repay the missed
          days. Allah says:
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p class="mb-0"><q>Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief) their past will be
                forgiven.</q></p>
            <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">Suuratul-Anfaal, verse 38</cite></footer>
        </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If he should accept Islam during the day (i.e. after fajr) during the month of Ramadan, he is to refrain from
          eating and drinking till the time of iftaar (time for breaking fast). This because he has become of those on
          whom fasting is compulsory after accepting Islam. However, it is not compulsory that he should repay the
          fasting of that day because as at the time the fasting started that day, he was yet to be a believer.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right    "></i> A Muslim child that has not reached maturity age</h3>
        <p>The ruling is that fasting is not compulsory on him until he matures. The prophet (S.A.W) said, “the pen has
          been lifted up for three (1) a sleeping person until he wakes up (2) a child until he matures (3) a mentally
          sick person until he regains his mental healthiness. (At-Tirmidhi 1423 - Al-Huduud; Ahmad vol1. Pg 158).</p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, it was part of the traditions of the pious predecessors as guardians and parents of children to
          command them to fast so that they can find fasting easy and customary when they mature. Today, many Muslim
          parents on the contrary, prevent their children from fasting believing that, it is a way to show mercy to
          these children. In reality, showing mercy to these children is to train them from childhood with the pristine
          Islamic education. Whosoever prevents these children from learning this education has indeed become unjust to
          them.
          But, if after these children have fasted and the parents noticed that it is becoming uneasy on them, then,
          they can prevent them from fasting.</p>
        <p>A male child becomes mature having experience one of three.
          <ol type="I">
            <li>Ejaculation, as a result of wet dream or otherwise. (See Suuratun Nuur, verse 59)</li>
            <li>Growing of hairs around body private parts. ‘Atiyyah Al- Quradhiyy said: “On the day of Quraydhah, we
              were
              presented to the Prophet (S.A.W) and anyone who was mature among us, whether he has experienced
              ejaculation or grown pubic hairs, was executed while the immature ones were left”. (At-Tirmidhi, As-sayr,
              1584; An-Nasaai, At-Talaq, 3429).</li>
            <li>Attainment of 15 years old. Abdullah bin Umar said,” I was presented to the Prophet (S.A.W) as a child
              of 14 years old on the day of Uhud. He did not grant me permission to follow them to the Battle”.
              (Al-Bukhari-As-shahaadaat, 2521). Al-Bayhaqi and Ibn-Hibban added, that Ibn Umar further said: “the
              Prophet (S.A.W) did not see me as being mature. So, when it was the day of Khandaq, I have reached 15
              years old, he granted me exam permission.”</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the three mentioned for a male child, a female child reaches maturity whenever she starts
          experiencing menstruation. Whenever she begins to menstruate, the compulsion falls on her, even if she has not
          reached 10 years of age. If she attains maturity in the afternoon on a fasting day, she would complete the
          fast but she does not have to repay that day.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right    "></i> A mentally sick person. </h3>
        <p>Because is not mentally fit, he is not conscious of his senses. Consequently, fasting is not compulsory on
          him as stated in the hadith of the prophet (S.A.W) about three for whom the pen has been lifted. If he fasts,
          it would not be correct. Because he is not conscious of his actions, he is not able to make intentions before
          actions and actions are built on intentions. If he only gets sick mentally sometimes, not every time, fasting
          is only compulsory on him, whenever he is mentally sick. If he becomes mentally sick in the afternoon on the
          day of fasting while he is fasting, his fasting is still valid because he intended fasting and started it in a
          conscious state. There is no evidence indicating the voidness of his fasting, especially when the period of
          his mental sickness can be defined. Therefore, it is not compulsory on him to repay that day. This is also
          applicable to someone who fainted while fasting as a result of sickness or otherwise</p>
        <p>If a mentally sick person becomes healthy or regain his mental healthiness in the afternoon on the day of
          fasting, he is to refrain from fasting till iftaar time but he is not to repay that day. His case is similar
          to a child getting mature or a disbeliever accepting Islam as mentioned above.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right    "></i> An old person whose agedness has made him lose his sense or
          faculty.</h3>
        <p>The ruling is that fasting is not compulsory on him and he is not to feed, in lieu of the fast. Losing his
          consciousness or distinguishing factor puts him in the position of a child that is yet to mature. However, if
          he regains his consciousness sometimes, then fasting becomes compulsory, only when is conscious.</p>
        <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-point-right    "></i> A weak or sick person that is not expected to
          recover.</h3>
        <p> The ruling is that fasting is not compulsory on him. He is only to feed a poor person in lieu of every
          single
          day he misses.</p>

        <p>O Allah, make us understand your religion and inspire us to know the secret behind your legislations. Make
          our affairs in both lives perfect. Forgive us, our parents and all the Muslims, for You are the most merciful
          of the merciful ones. O Allah, shower Your blessings upon the prophet, his households and his companions in
          general.</p>
