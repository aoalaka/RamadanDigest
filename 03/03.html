        </div>
        <h3 class="my-4 text-danger">Simply put, it is NOT PERMISSIBLE!!!</h3>
        <p>The two main reasons and wisdom that can be deduced from the numerous Prophetic traditions that legislated
          Zakãtu-l-Fitr are:</p>
        <p>1. طعمة المساكين: As a means of feeding the poor. </p>
        <p> 2. طهرة للصائمين من اللغو الرفث: As purification for the one who has engaged in the fasting, from foul
          utterances and obscene actions.</p>
        <p>
          Concerning the first reason for paying Zakãtul-Fitr, Sheik Muhammed Bn Soolih Al-uthaymeen (May Allah be
          pleased with his soul) said what I paraphrase as follows:
          <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
            <p><q>ALLAH Messenger (S.A.W) said "طعمة" as a source of food and not something else. He further said, money
                is used to meet myriads of needs of which feeding is among. However, food is not the only need that is
                met with cash. So For ALLAH to have inspired His Messenger to mention food and NOT cash, then it must be
                for a reason based on His Perfect Wisdom.</q></p>
          </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>Still on the fact that ONLY FOOD is permissible, he said:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
          <p class="mb-0"><q>If ALLAH had wished it to be payed with cash, He could have inspired His Messenger to
              mention a particular type of food. Contrary to that, different types of food items were mentioned. Which
              included; Barely, Wheat, Dates, Maize, and Cheese e.t.c.</q></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He said that, to unify the worth of all these various food items in monetary terms would be an Herculean
          task. The implication of that is; meeting up with the required measure by ALLAH may NOT be achievable. He also
          mentioned as a demerit of paying it with cash, the possibility of the intended benefits NOT reaching
          all the members of the indigent family. As the head of the family could simply pocket the cash and divert it
          to meet other needs than FOOD.</p>
        <p>Al-Imaam Al-Albaaniy (May ALLAH be pleased with his soul) also has the following to say concerning the
          issue:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
          <p class="mb-0"><q>Let everyone who claims that paying Zakãtul-Fitr with its worth in CURRENCY is more
              beneficial to the poor than with FOOD be cautious of his mistake in two regards: i) contradiction of the
              scripture on an affair of worship with regards to which prioritizing human
              intellect is NOT permissible. ii) such person is also claiming that the Legislator of Islamic Laws- ALLAH
              the Most- Wise- when He
              inspired to His Messenger the ruling on Zakãtul-Fitr was not aware of what was best for the poor then,
              and what would be the best for them after the demise of His Messenger (S.A.W).</q>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>MAY ALLAH SAVE US FROM THE EVIL OF PLACING OUR ERRING INTELLECT OVER THE PERFECT WISDOM OF ALLAH AND HIS
          MESSENGER... AAMIIN.</p>
